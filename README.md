# Calculator

## About the project

This project aims to emulate a basic level calculator, above everything, the look of a conventional calculator and also some basic number operations like summation, subtraction, multiplication and also division.

It was made as the conclusion from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-calculator) JavaScript foundations course.

### Tools used

- **HTML**
- **CSS**
  - Grid layout
  - Pseudo class selector
- **JavaScript**
  - DOM Manipulation

## Functionalities

As mentioned before the calculator has four different number operations:

### Summation

On the sum operation, the calculator can sum two numbers provided by the user.

### Subtraction

On the subtraction operation, the calculator can subtract two numbers provided by the user, but now we can get _negative numbers_ as result!

### Multiplication

On the multiplication operation, the calculator will multiply two numbers provided by the user, and by that its possible to get _decimal numbers_ as result.

### Division

On the division operation, the calculator will divide to numbers provided by the user, but in addition to being able to receive decimal numbers as result, the calculator will throw an **error** if the user tries to divide by zero.

## Possible improvements

Well, the project is, by no mean perfect, and it has some really noticeable room for improvement (and bugs).
So i made a little list to keep track of thing that can be improved, and maybe, someday i may work on then :)

- Implement a keyboard support
- Fix some bugs:
  - You can't subtract a negative number from another negative number
- Maybe rewrite the code, make it more efficient or even compact.

## Conclusion

It was quite a fun project to work on, at the beginning i was apprehensive to start the project, maybe because i was insecure to use my knowledge gathered through The Odin Project, but as soon as i started i gained confidence and was able to finish the project, and present a functioning calculator.
